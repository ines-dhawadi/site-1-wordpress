  <p>Thank you for using Team Showcase with Slider. I Just wanted to see if you have any questions or concerns about my plugins. If you do, Please do not hesitate to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/team-showcase-supreme/" target="_blank">file a bug report</a></p>
  <p>By the way, did you know we also have a <a href="http://www.wpmart.org/downloads/team-showcase-supreme-pro/" target="_blank">Premium Version</a>? It offers 30+ templates with exclusive CSS3 effects. It also comes with 16/7 personal support.</p>

  <p style="color: green">If the grid is broken in output, then go "WPM Team" -> "Setting" menu. Then select the "Yes" option from "Fix grid broken in output" and check now in output. It will be fixed your grid broken issue.</p>
  <p>Thanks Again!</p>
